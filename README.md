## To get Flask up and running
First, navigate to the direction containing `application.py`. On a Mac, first run the following: `export FLASK_APP=application.py` and then `export FLASK_DEBUG=1`. 

On a PC, first run `set FLASK_APP=application.py` and then `set FLASK_DEBUG=1`.

From that point, get Flask running using `flask run`. The above steps need to be re-done every time you open a new terminal window.
